# Business Recommendations

1️⃣ Boost Sales During Low Months:

Run special discounts and promotions in July and August since sales are low.

Take advantage of peak months (October & March) by increasing ads and stock.

2️⃣ Focus on High-Potential Regions:

Invest more in top-performing regions (South & Midwest) since they bring in the most revenue.

Try to improve sales in low-revenue states (Wyoming, Montana) by running targeted marketing campaigns.

3️⃣ Target Customers Based on Age:

Since people aged 40-50 spend the most, create special offers for them.

Attract younger customers (under 20) by offering student discounts and influencer promotions.

4️⃣ Different Marketing for Men & Women:

Promote beauty, fashion, and kids' products more to women.

Advertise electronics, appliances, and computing products more to men.

5️⃣ Smart Discounts Strategy:

Discounts increase sales, but too many can reduce profits.

Offer limited-time deals instead of always giving big discounts.
